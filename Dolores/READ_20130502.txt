I implemented a very simple modification of the sleeve curves in order to adjust the arc lengths of the front/back part with the corresponding sleeve part.

Results: 
1) If the arc lengths differ too much, the shape of the sleeve is not nice any more.
2) Algorithm to adjust the curve fails sometimes

--> We have to talk about what we could improve!

Suggestions what to do:
1) It is very important that the drafting of the front/back part and of the sleeve is done in a good way. We should really focus on a good drafting!
2) Use of better optimization methods for the adjustment of the sleeve.
